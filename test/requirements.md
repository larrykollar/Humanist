# Requirements

The %vars.ProdName%
has two major requirements:

POSIX compliance
:  MacOS, Linux, and BSD systems are POSIX-compliant.
   The primary requirements are `bash`, `awk`, and `sed`.
   For Windows, use either WSL (tested with Ubuntu) or [Cygwin].

[Pandoc]
:  Use version 3.8 or newer.
   Pandoc can convert content to a large variety of formats,
   so you can extend the Humanist Publishing System as needed.
