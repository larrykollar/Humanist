# Publishing

The %vars.ProdName%
is, at its core, a collection of scripts
intended to produce PDF output
from a collection of Markdown files.
A "book" file, a tab-indented text file
described in [Book file format],
provides order and structure to the book.

As discussed earlier,
you can also use the %vars.ProdName%
with monolithic Markdown files
(as you would with word processors).
This allows working
with automatically-generated documents
without having to break up the document.
