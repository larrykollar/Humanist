# Requirements

The Humanist Publishing System
has two major requirements:

POSIX compliance
:  MacOS and Linux systems are POSIX-compliant.
   The primary requirements are `bash`, `awk`, and `sed`.
   For Windows, use either WSL (tested with Ubuntu) or [Cygwin].

Pandoc
:  Use version 3.8 or newer.
   Pandoc can convert content to a large variety of formats,
   so you can extend the Humanist Publishing System as needed.

Cygwin: https://cygwin.com/
