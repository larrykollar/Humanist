# Publishing

The Humanist Publishing System
is, at its core, a collection of scripts
intended to produce PDF output
from a collection of Markdown files.
A "book" file, a tab-indented text file
described in [Book file format],
provides order and structure to the book.

As discussed earlier,
you can also use the Humanist Publishing System
with monolithic Markdown files
(as you would with word processors).
This allows working
with automatically-generated documents
without having to break up the document.


Book file format: [bookfile.md]
